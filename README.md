Bot for automatic gameplay at Monopoly One

### Installation and running
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to Monopoly One and log in (or register if you don't have an account)
3. Go to Monopoly One's main page
4. Launch main.py
5. Enjoy automated gameplay, lol.

Make sure that site is opened in a fully expanded window (not fullscreen though) and all buttons aren't covered by any other windows.
Try to lower the confidence or to remake the samples if bot does not detect buttons.
